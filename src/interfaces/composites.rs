//!
//!
//! These are wrappers that are very small but have big impacts, mostly used
//!
//!
//! LaminarComposites => transportation based wrappers
//! ParticulateComposites => automative based wrappers, non-repetetive solution
//! HybridComposites => wrappers that use Polymers, ceramics, or alloys
//! PolymerMatrixComposites => wrappers that use or are in some polymers, calendar fns,
//! CeramicMatrixComposites => wrappers that use or are in some ceramics, abstractors..
//! AlloyMatrixComposites => wrappers that use or are in some alloys..
