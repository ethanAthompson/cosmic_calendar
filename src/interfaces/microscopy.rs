//! Microscopy is a scientific technique that involves the 
//! use of microscopes to observe and study objects or specimens 
//! that are too small to be seen with the naked eye. 
//! Microscopes magnify the details of tiny structures, 
//! allowing researchers and scientists to analyze and 
//! understand the characteristics of materials, cells, microorganisms, 
//! and other minute entities.
//!
//! These are tests for alloys, ceramics, polymers, and composites
//!
//! OpticalMicroScopy => to see if the structure is legit
//! XRayMicroScopy => to see if the nested structures are legit
//! RamanMicroScopy => use a specific test for each alloy, ceramic, polymer and composite
//! CyrogenicMicroScopy => to see if a alloy, ceramic, polymer, or composite works at multiple angles
